In order to achieve this will conducty technical analysis on a dataser we have from Kickstarter.

**Analysis and Challenges**

First we looked at crowdfunding results based on launch date. We bucketed the data by monht based on launch dates, to then create a summary of how many projects have been succesful , failed and canceled by month. In order to make the analysis more relevant to Louise we then focused mainly on Theater projects by filtering this summary by that Parent Category. Finally we created a line graph to visualize the analysis and draw conclusions. Final graph attached below:

In order to make the analysis more relevant to Louise we focused mainly on Play project subcategory. Finally we created a line graph to visualize the analysis and draw conclusions.
