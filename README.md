The purpose of the analysis is to help Louise understand how different crowdfunding campaigns have fared in relationship to their launch dates and their finding goals, to help compare to what she her progress in funding he play *Fever*. In order to achieve this will conducty technical analysis on a dataser we have from Kickstarter.

**Analysis and Challenges**

First we looked at crowdfunding results based on launch date. We first we bucketed the data by monht based on launch dates, to the create a summary of how many projects have been succesful , failed and canceled by month. In order to make the analysis more relevant to Louise we then focused mainly on Theater projects by filtering this summary by that Parent Category. Finally we created a line graph to visualize the analysis and draw conclusions. Final graph attached below:
